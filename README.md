# NetEvolve.ArchiDuct

***ArchiDuct*** (short version for `NetEvolve.ArchiDuct`) is a neologism that refers to the architecture of equaducts. The equaduct already proved the necessity of planning and foresight in early antiquity.
The same principles of planning and foresight are still valid, but now we are using them to build networks and systems.

The ***ArchiDuct*** NuGet packages provides a set of fluent APIs to help you build and evolve your component and system architectures. It will help you to define the components, their relationships, and the rules that govern their interactions.

## Inspiration
We are inspired by [ArchUnitNET](https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnitNET) and [NetArchTest](https://github.com/BenMorris/NetArchTest), which are great libraries for testing architecture rules. However, we wanted to provide a more fluent API to define the architecture rules and to help you build your architecture. In a much simpler and complete way, we want to help you to build your architecture, not just test it.
